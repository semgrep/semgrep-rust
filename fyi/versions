      chore: Update tree-sitter-rust (3/n)
      
      Among other things, this pulls in some significant changes how macros
      are handled. There were two major changes, months apart, and I wanted to
      pull them both in at once, so this is a fairly major jump.
      
      I also ran in to a weird issue parsing the Semgrep ellipsis that was
      sorted out in a later commit, so I pulled in some more commits after the
      macro changes as well.
      
      Test plan: Automated tests, plus pulled this in to Semgrep and verified
      that tests pass there.
